# EXPERIMENT-6
## AIM:To write a Python program for checking Palindrome and to write test cases for ir. 

## ALGORITHM

Step 1: Start

Step 2: Get an input from the user by prompting

Step 3: Run a loop form 0 to len/2.

Step 4: Check if the characters are the same both from the start and the end till len/2.

Step 5: If it is, return the result that it is a palindrome.

Step 6: Else, return that it is not a palindrome.

Step 7: Stop. 

## PROGRAM
```python

```

## OUTPUT

## RESULT
